                <p>Achiever. Determined. Motivated.</p>
                <p>I used to work as a Maintenance Manager for a chain of hotels called Intercontinental Hotel Group in
                    England, and recently, I had the opportunity to do a career change. I've began studying for Web
                    Development by myself, and in October 2018, I started the Full Stack Web Development course at UCSD
                    Entension. I graduated top of my class, and rapidly found my passion for Web Development,
                    particularly on the backend with Node.js and its dependencies.</p>
                <p>I really enjoy the challenges and problem solving intricacies of Web Development, because those keep
                    me engaged and curious. I'm always able and willing to learn new technologies as the job demands.
                    Even if the job doesn't demand, I like to keep myself up to date on new technologies, because there
                    are always existing problems that can be solved in more efficient ways.</p>
                <p>I'm a team player, but also work well independently. I have a mind that is "client oriented" from my
                    previous job, which can be very helpful when trying to understand and capture clients' business
                    needs and requirements, and at the same time, I know how to deliver great customer experience.</p>
                <p>It all comes down to how much you want it, and how much effort you are willing to put in to get it. I
                    really want this, and I devoted lots of hours developing projects and pages to the point where,
                    today, I can say I'm proud to call myself a Full Stack Web Developer!</p>
